# BudgetingForTeens

Our small web/iphone app for MLH prime hackathon. We have decided to learn some new technology and we have not finished this in 24 hours. 
Goal was to build app that would help young people with managing money. We decided for bubble design where you set up your budget plan for each category and then as you spend the money bubble grows. When you reach the limit bubble should pop up.
